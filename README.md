# Stock-Tracker

This application is built with HTML, CSS, and hosted with Python, more specifically the Python library, Flask. Used the dotenv library to load my API key. Used matplotlib to display the graph. Takes in user input of company code and interval and returns a graph. CSS is done with Bootstrap.
